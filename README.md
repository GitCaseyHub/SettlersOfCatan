<h1>Settlers of Catan</h1>
This is my version of 'Settlers of Catan'. The game is completely finished and plays best on a screen 1920x1080 as that enables status screens to be visible if 3-4 players are playing.
<br><br>A shortcut key has been implemented for cancellation of actions. Hold ALT_C when the Catan Board has focus, and this will enable an OptionPane to appear that allows for cancellation.
<br><br>And as for game additions I wanted to talk about, I have implemented a class system to the game that makes it more difficult (it is optional; choose the settler class if you want the standard game) as well as optional cataclysm events that can affect player resources at a 5% chance. As well, ports are optional as I've heard some people say they are too exploitable. Again, these three things are optional.
<br><br>Additionally, I have added two custom modes: Democracy & Random. Random randomizes all tiles and their numbers every turn; Democracy allows players to elect a leader every turn cycle (and they can't vote themselves) that can choose how they roll on their turn. Also, there is now a 'Desertification' feature, giving each tile a 0.1% chance of morphing into a desert every turn. And, if a player uses the 'Arsonist' class, fires now have a 1% chance of spreading to adjacent tiles (if the 'Wildfire' option is enabled). As with the previous paragraph, these features are optional.
<br><br>And finally, all the image files used in this game are not my own. They are all sourced from Google Images (non-copyrighted, as far as I can tell).
